Uh, uh
Life's like this
Uh, huh, uh, huh
That's the way it is

'Cause life's like this
Uh, huh, uh, huh
That's the way it is

Chill out, whatcha yellin' for?
Lay back, it's all been done before
And if you could only let it be
You would see

I like you the way you are
When we're drivin' in your car
And you're talkin' to me one-on-one
But you become

Somebody else 'round everyone else
You're watchin' your back like you can't relax
You're tryin' to be cool
You look like a fool to me
Tell me

Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're
Actin' like you're somebody else, gets me frustrated
And life's like this, you

And you fall, and you crawl, and you break
And you take what you get
And you turn it into
Honesty, and promise me I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no, no

You come over unannounced
Dressed up like you're somethin' else
Where you are and where it's at? You see
You're makin' me

Laugh out when you strike your pose
Take off all your preppy clothes
You know, you're not foolin' anyone
When you become

Somebody else 'round everyone else
You're watchin' your back like you can't relax
You're tryin' to be cool
You look like a fool to me
Tell me

Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're
Actin' like you're somebody else, gets me frustrated
Life's like this, you

And you fall, and you crawl, and you break
And you take what you get
And you turn it into
Honesty, and promise me I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no, no

No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

Chill out, whatcha yellin' for?
Lay back, it's all been done before
And if you could only let it be
You will see

Somebody else 'round everyone else
You're watchin' your back like you can't relax
You're tryin' to be cool
You look like a fool to me
Tell me

Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're
Actin' like you're somebody else, gets me frustrated
Life's like this, you

And you fall, and you crawl, and you break
And you take what you get
And you turn it into
Honesty, and promise me I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no

Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated? (Ayy, yeah!)
I see the way you're
Actin' like you're somebody else, gets me frustrated
Life's like this, you

And you fall, and you crawl, and you break
And you take what you get
And you turn it into
Honesty, and promise me I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no, no
